<p><em>SicEm365 Lead Recruiting Analyst and Co-Editor Grayson Grundhoefer provides insider notes from the Bears&#39; first scrimmage of fall camp.</em></p>

<hr />
<h3>Scattershooting News</h3>

<p>Baylor&rsquo;s starting offense played just a single series together&nbsp;as Sawyer Robertson (RSr.), Michael Trigg (RSr.), Bryson Washington (RSo.), Josh Cameron (RSr.), Ashtyn Hawkins (6Sr.)&nbsp;and a were&nbsp;not full participants for the scrimmage portion. I expect Baylor to do everything it can to avoid any more potential injuries.</p>

<p>The defense won the day by a significant margin. They created a ton of pressure even against the first-string offensive line. They created multiple turnovers, and the secondary really thrived. It was a very good statement made by the defense. They took advantage of the missing pieces, but still, it was a promising day.</p>

<p>Redshirt freshman quarterback Nate Bennett got the start in place of Robertson. He has been running&nbsp;with the second-stringers&nbsp;since the spring, as we have reported multiple times throughout the offseason. I heard he did well compared to the rest of the group, but it was a rough day for everyone in the passing game offensively. Both Walker White (RFr.) and Edward Griffin (Fr.) threw one interception each. Overall, it was not a good day for the offense.</p>

<p>If the offensive starters get back on the field next weekend, it will be interesting to see if they are able to bounce back or if the staff decides to play conservatively again this week to avoid injuries.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Running Backs</h3>

<p>The big news that came out Saturday was junior running back Dawson Pendergrass missing the entire 2025 season due to a foot injury. This is a really unfortunate situation, and he is a key loss for the offense. It also limits the depth and what Jake Spavital can do with his running backs. The biggest losses are in&nbsp;the short-yardage area and in terms of experience. Pendergrass has a great feel for getting through the initial contact with his balance and strength. Besides that, he is a very good leader for the running back room and has played a ton of football the past two seasons. He will be missed for sure, and it will be something that is challenged even more once the grind of the season starts.</p>

<p>The positive side of things is the way true freshman Caden Knighten reacted to this injury by going out and doing what he has done since the spring, creating explosive plays. He had another 50-plus-yard&nbsp;touchdown run, which adds to the two he had in the spring scrimmages. Knighten&rsquo;s speed, balance, strength, quickness, and pass-catching have shone since the moment he arrived on Baylor&rsquo;s campus. He was going to have a significant role even if Pendergrass was healthy, but now he will be asked to do a lot during the season. As I have stated since the spring, he is more than ready for this opportunity, and fans are going to be very excited to see how talented he is.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Offensive Line</h3>

<p><strong>OL Scrimmage Depth Chart:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>LT</strong> - Sidney Fugar (RSr.)&nbsp;/ Sean Thompkins (RSo.)</li>
	<li><strong>LG</strong> - Ryan Lengyel (RSr.) / Colton Thomasson (RSo.)</li>
	<li><strong>C </strong>- Coleton Price (RJr.) / Koltin Sieracki (RFr.)</li>
	<li><strong>RG</strong> - Harrison Cluff (Fr.)</li>
	<li><strong>RT</strong> - Kaden Sieracki (RJr.) / Joe Crocker (RSo.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Starting right guard Omar Aigbedion (Sr.) was dealing with a minor injury, so he was held out for most of the scrimmage, but he will be fine.</p>

<p>Overall, it was not the best day for the group as a whole, and not a great performance by one of the strongest groups on the team, specifically in pass protection. The defense was getting after the quarterbacks quite a bit on Saturday. There were some positives at times in the run game, but it wasn&rsquo;t significant enough to mask what happened in the pass game. I expect a big bounce back next weekend.</p>

<hr />
<h3>Defensive Backs</h3>

<p>The secondary had a really good day, which was a big positive coming from this weekend. The specific position I heard the best things about was the cornerbacks. The starters, LeVar Thornton (RSo.) and Tevin Williams III (RSr.), continue to put together a strong fall after a very good spring. These two seem to have cemented themselves as the starting cornerbacks to start the season. Based on the spring and fall, I think Caden Jenkins (Jr.) is the current No. 3 with Calvin Simpson-Hunt (RSo.) as the No. 4. All four of these guys will play a lot, and right now Paul Gonzales&#39; position is trending toward&nbsp;being one of the most improved units on the team this upcoming season.</p>

<p>Head coach Dave Aranda mentioned that starting STAR Carl Williams IV (Jr.) is dealing with an injury (meniscus) and is still operating at just 70% right now, so he doesn&rsquo;t overdo it. Aranda and Williams think he will be 100% for the season; that is the expectation by both, but we will see how that goes. It is tough to hear more of these types of things about Williams, as he was never really fully 100% last season. It clearly impacted him, and this news makes you concerned if he will be able to make that big jump everyone is expecting. DJ Coleman (Jr.), Kendrick Simpkins (6Sr.)&nbsp;and Bo Onu (Fr.) are getting reps&nbsp;at the STAR position, but Coleman continues to stand out to me as a complete overall player.&nbsp;He came down with an interception during the scrimmage. Simpkins is a good pass rusher and run stopper, but in coverage, he still has question marks. Onu has adjusted well to the college game and looks like he is on track to be a good player during his time at Baylor.</p>

<h3>Other Notable Standouts</h3>

<p>Four other specific names that I heard stood out were Matthew Fobbs-White (Jr.), Adonis Friloux (RSr.)&nbsp;Kaleb Burns (Fr.)&nbsp;and Kamauryn Morgan (Fr.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fobbs-White and Friloux were constantly in the backfield and were disruptive for the defense. This is not a huge surprise for Fobbs-White as he has been wreaking havoc since he arrived in Waco. He is a very good pass rusher, and he continues to excel in that area. Friloux created a big push and blew up plays before they started, something Apu Ika did exceptionally well during his time at Baylor. IF this continues, then the Bears will be in a good spot defensively. This Tulane duo is standing&nbsp;out right now.</p>

<p>Morgan and Burns have shown&nbsp;flashes this fall, and it continued on Saturday. These two were tied with Caden Knighten as my top prospects in the 2025 class, and it looks like the coaching staff landed three big-time performers who may all burn their redshirt. My hope is that Burns can redshirt with the veteran depth the Bears have at linebacker, but this push he is making may make it difficult not to get him on the field some. Morgan will likely need to play a depth role at EDGE, which is a good thing, as I think he is ready to be on the field early on in his career. This is great news for the program&#39;s future, having two playmakers like this on defense flash early on.</p>

Gary Patterson was infamous for throwing a bunch of blitzes out there and giving a bunch of exotic looks early in camp. It probably hindered some of his offenses but it helped his defenses come together. I wonder if something like that is going on. </b>                        </div>

I assume Phoenix Jackson will line up in certain packages and Jeremy Evans is still lower on the depth chart? What about Kyland Reed?<hr></blockquote><br />Barnes and Jackson are basically 2A and 2B right now depending on package, and assuming they will play a lot together. <br /><br />Reed has been really solid at MLB. <br /><br />I like that group and its depth a lot right now. Evans included, but I haven't heard his name much. <hr></blockquote><br /><br />It seems this is by far the most talent we've had at LB under Aranda from a depth standpoint. 2021 was better up top, but can't remember the last time we had an All Conference 1st team caliber LB with pure talent like Burns/Reed/Winston as well.<hr></blockquote><br />Last year was solid. Keaton and Matt were both very good. The depth behind them was a challenge. Until the performance shows in a game it's hard to trust all of them but the raw talent is different. </b>                        </div>
